Thailand’s ministry of education has launched the remote studying process through TV programs and online platforms for students who could not return to their schools. However, there are some concerns about the readiness of Thai students, especially when several media outlets reveal that many families are not ready or have to buy a new TV or mobile phone to support their kids.</strong></p>\n<p>The survey result from The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2018, which includes data from 8,633 respondents who were Thai students aged 15 in 290 educational institutions, indicates that 68.7 per cent of these students had a quiet place to do their homework or reading a book in their houses. However, when focusing on the group of the poorest 20 per cent of students, only 55.03 per cent of them had that kind of quiet place. Meanwhile, although most of the student families owned at least one television and mobile phone, there were students in the poorest group who did not have access to the mobile phone at around 20 per cent.</p>\n<p>This data was interpreted by Dr Pumsaran Tongliemnak, the economics of education specialist at Thailand’s Equitable Education Fund. He tells us that there must be other ways to support this group of impoverished students, such as delivering textbooks, workbooks, and other documents, to student homes. These methods will help these students study at home or allow their parents to teach them. At the same time, local teachers, governesses, volunteers, and even senior students play an essential role in teaching these students at home.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this solution cannot completely prevent the dropout problem.</p>\n<p>“The most worried group of students are the poorest students, the students whose parents were affected economically by this Coronavirus crisis, and the students who previously have the risk to be dropped out from education system. It’s not easy for them to go to school even in a normal situation. When they face economic or social crises or long school holidays that make these students not meet their teachers, they don’t go to school and have a higher chance of being dropped out from the education system. These students are from the country borders, the impoverished students in urban environments, and the students in rural or remote areas where teachers cannot follow up student lives,” says Pumsaran, “The essential factor which prevents students from dropping out is the follow-up of teachers. And the intensity level of the follow-up may vary in different schools, especially when students are stepping from one grade level cluster to another, which they may move to another school. This is another challenge.”</p>\n<p>Pumsaran also mentions starvation and malnutrition problems among poor students. He emphasizes that the free education policy is not enough to keep impoverished students from dropping out. He says that when the school holidays become longer, these students should receive tentative help such as delivering the food to their homes or allowing students to get the food somewhere.</p>\n<p>“For students in the poorest group, the free education policy may make them don’t have to pay tuition fees or uniform fees. However, it does not cover opportunity costs such as the poor students whose parents need their assistance to make a living or work on a farm, transportation costs, or other expenses during their study that the free education policy cannot cover. Sometimes these students don’t have even the money to use the public transportation system to go to school or to buy some food at their school.” Pumsaran adds.</p>\n<p>The problem of inequalities is also reflected by Assoc. Prof. Athapol Anunthavorasakul, the director of the Research and Development Center on Education for Sustainable Development at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand. He is concerned about the impoverished students in the urban environment because they are minorities in big schools, so they might sometimes be ignored and pulled out of studying through digital channels. Blending some offline studying methods, such as delivering handouts to student homes with online studying, might be a way to help this group of students. However, the more essential things are continuous interaction and follow-up between teachers and students. If possible, the teachers should arrange some schedule to have face-to-face meetings with their students at school to prevent their students from being dropped out of the education system.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes there is recklessness, for example, you know from a survey result that every student has their mobile phone, but they can top up their phone only 50 baht per once to use only for contact with their family. If they want to stay online using a mobile phone, they have to upgrade their internet package. When it comes to online classes are in Zoom (an online meeting application), the situation will be more difficult because they may be able to stay online only 30 minutes at most,” Athapol adds.</p>\n<p>Both Pumsaran and Athapol indicates that these deficiencies reflect that the way the government uses to allocate budget per head of students, by allocating it equally, might not be appropriate with Thailand’s context anymore.</p>\n<p>“We have to check that which students lack money to study, or even check their parents’ employment status because if their parents are unemployed, the children will starve,” says Athapol.</p>\n<p>Not only challenges about inequality but the challenge about the effectiveness of remote studying has also been questioned. After a month of discussion with teachers in many areas in Thailand about teaching under the ‘abnormal’ situation as nowadays, Athapol raises his concern that the duration which students have to watch lesson videos per day will suit students’ interests or behaviour at their home or not. He believed that there would be some feedback from parents or guardians about this issue.</p>\n<p>“If the school executives force the students to watch the lesson videos of seven classes per day straightforwardly, but in fact, they cannot force their students at home, especially middle and high school students. These students will try to find other sources of knowledge that are more understandable. However, even though the guideline from the government is currently not forcing schools to do this, it still orders the teachers to report the works’ results to their affiliation. This will lead to ‘Do a thing, but report another thing’ behaviour because the teachers cannot monitor that their students watched their lessons or not, but they will indicate in the report that all students watched the lessons neatly,” says Athapol.</p>\n<p>“Some schools already sent online lessons timetable to the students. Then, some students asked, ‘Do I really have to watch online lessons 4 hours a day?’, and their parents would not know how to explain to their children the situation although they understand schools’ necessity. Eventually, children’s power will force their parents to give the feedback to schools,” he adds, “But I worry about the lower-middle-income families who don’t have the power to give the feedback. Suppose a family has five children and there are 17 educational TV channels, so a grade 5 student may have to watch TV simultaneously as a grade 3 student, and how can you cope with this challenge? Finally, this situation pushes the schools to lie their affiliation.”</p>\n<p>He also explains the online workshop he arranged to demonstrate the online learning environment to the teachers “I want them to understand the environment when students have to stay on Zoom application or listen to lesson videos. Some videos I assigned these teachers to watch are 10-15 minutes long. Then I asked them that they watched all parts of the video at once or not, and they accepted that they also had some breaks during their watching. So, I continued to ask them about the duration of the lessons video they recorded for their children, and an answer from a teacher was ’50 minutes’. Although you’re a teacher, you still have a coffee break, but if your students have to listen to you for 50 minutes, can your students cope with it?”</p>\n<p>He also indicates that in a well-designed online learning system, the lesson videos must be divided into small clips with an appropriate amount and form of content. For example, the duration of each video clip for middle or high school students should not be longer than 10 minutes, or there should be time provided for some activities at students’ homes in which the students can learn more than one subject and manage their time by themselves. They also can submit their worksheets or homework through email. Athapol concludes that these ways align with the principle of online learning, which allows students to lead and regulate themselves.</p>\n<p>The next challenge is the channels for communications. Athapol points out that schools have to prepare for many contacts in every medium, both from students and their guardians, to prevent the teachers from having too heavy burdens.</p>\n<p>“Suppose a school assigns their teachers to open a Facebook group for a module, open a LINE (chat application) group for parents, and answer the phone calls, then the teachers will have to deal with a lot of communications from every channel. The students will ask you something on Facebook, the parents will send LINE messages to you or call you, and you—as a teacher—still l have to prepare your classes. So, the chaos is awaiting you. The management should arrange a clear schedule when teachers will be available for communications each day, then other time slots will only be for class preparation, homework marking or giving feedback to students. So, you have to design both students and teachers lives,” says Athapol.</p>\n<p>Another experience about remote learning preparation is from Anawat Nuntasen, a mathematics teacher at Baan Piang Luang School in Chiangmai province of Thailand. He tells us in the morning of 18 May, which should be a semester opening date if there is no COVID-19 in this world. However, the pandemic made him has to prepare remote learning processes for his students instead.</p>\n<p>The classroom which he is responsible for has around 30 students. The financial statuses of these students are so varied, from the rich to the poor. There is 10-20 per cent of poor students, and Anawat says that the teachers have to carefully take care of this group of students, especially in this abnormal situation.</p>\n<p>“The problem is ... some student houses still have no electricity nowadays,” He accepts.</p>\n<p>There is a policy from the Ministry of Education to give impoverished students the set-top box to provide access to TV Channels for remote learning purposes. Nonetheless, lack of electricity, which is essential infrastructure, also obstruct these students from learning at their houses. Meanwhile, some parents or guardians complain that they cannot retune their televisions to watch TV channels for remote learning.</p>\n<p>“Initially, I told my students that they should go to watch those TV channels at their friends’ houses if their friends live closed to their home,” says Anawat, “Developing students who lack access to these things is a big problem, this problem exists everywhere, and we have that such students in every class. I may have to visit their houses, arrange special tutorial sessions, or do anything possible to help them.”</p>\n<p>He continues telling us that his students feel exciting with a new remote learning system, as well as their parents or guardians. However, most parents or guardians in his areas are farmers, and they gave feedback that they cannot monitor their children during study time because they have to do their job outside their homes.</p>\n<p>Moreover, some parents or guardians are also concerned about learning achievement from the remote learning system. They lack confidence in this way of learning. Anawat has to explain to these parents or guardians during their student house visits that this time is only just a ‘trial phase’, and it could take a while to see the results of this new system.</p>\n<p>Before going back to giving school milk to his students’ parents, Anawat says that he still hopes to see a ‘new normal’ in the education system.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we have to live in the pandemic era nowadays. But when this pandemic is gone, I think that the way of education or teaching must be changed. It can’t still be the same. There must be some supportive systems because there may be other pandemics in the future, and the government should provide resources to support these systems as well.” Anawat concludes.</p>\n<p><strong>These are some challenges raised by people in Thailand’s education system when students depend on many screens to study.</strong></p>\n","title":"Big challenges appear when students learn remotely in the COVID-19 era","date":"2020-05-18","publisher":"THE STANDARD","publisherDesc":"(Thai news agency)","originalLang":"Thai","originalLink":"https://bit.ly/3EVhdlW","author":"Pasit Kongkunakornkul","photo":"","category":"Thailand News / In-depth Feature","linkOrText":"T"}},"__N_SSG":true}
