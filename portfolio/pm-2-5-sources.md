We are now in the middle of winter in Thailand, with the new wave of the pandemic. However, another big problem, fine particulate matter, or we called it ‘PM2.5’, is also here with us in Bangkok and surrounding provinces like in other years in the past. 

The big questions are, how is the progress in PM2.5 problem solving, and is the air quality nowadays better than in the past? We will bring you the latest insights into this problem in many aspects.

We will begin with the trend of the PM2.5 situation near your home. The graphs below show the amount of PM2.5 gathered from the monitoring stations of Thailand’s Pollution Control Department (PCD) in the last three winters, the ‘crisis’ period for the PM2.5 situation in Bangkok and surrounding areas.

The graphs indicate that in this winter, some areas such as Kanchanapisek Rd. (in Bangkuntien district, Bangkok), Mahachai subdistrict (in Muang Samut Sakon district, Samut Sakon province), or Oomnoi subdistrict (in Kratumban district, Samut Sakon province), were affected by PM2.5. The 24-hrs average concentrations of PM2.5 in these areas fell into the ‘Begin to affect health’ zone in the larger number of days than other areas. On some days, these concentrations also fell into the worst zone, ‘Affecting health’.

Moreover, we should not forget that Thailand’s national criteria defined these air quality zones. As we are writing this article, Thailand’s criteria still define the maximum value of 24-hrs average concentration of PM2.5 that is ‘up to par’ at not more than 50 micrograms per cubic meter. These criteria are criticized by some fellows and NGOs such as Greenpeace Southeast Asia, who have called for more stringent criteria. They expect that more stringent criteria will speed up problem-solving processes.

![PM2.5 problem in Bangkok](/images/portfolio/pm2-5/PM-8.jpg)

We also have the latest update about this issue. PCD already set up a recent hearing about the new criteria draft, which will adjust that maximum acceptable value of 24-hrs average concentration of PM2.5 down from 50 to 37 micrograms per cubic meter. The draft also changes the maximum allowable value of the yearly concentration of PM2.5, decreasing from 25 to 15 micrograms per cubic meter. These criteria are in line with the World Health Organization’s 3rd Phase interim goals. In comparison, Thailand’s current criteria are only following the 2nd phase of interim goals.

So, we provide another mode in the graph above, which shows you how the PM2.5 situation in your area is compared to the ‘new’ standard if the new criteria become effective. Just click the arrow in the upper right corner of the graph above to switch between these two standards.

In addition, we could see that the trend of PM2.5 quantity increases and decreases periodically. There will be different average amounts of these fine particles in each period. The next question is, how do each source contribute to the concentration of PM2.5? We are going to look back at the studies on this topic from now on.


## **The Wind, The Atmosphere and The Rain: How they affect PM2.5 problem?**

We would like to explore ‘uncontrollable’ factors which support PM2.5 accumulation. Generally, these factors are topography and meteorological conditions.

But if we focus only on Bangkok and surrounding areas, we may know that the high pressure or cold air masses from China usually spread to cover the upper part of Thailand in winter. The pressure difference between different areas is higher, which makes the northeast monsoon stronger and brings us cold or very cold weather. However, this high pressure is weak in some periods, so the difference in air pressure is also less. The northeast monsoon also weakens, or we call that a ‘calm wind’ arises.

When the high pressure combines with another phenomenon called ‘Temperature Inversion’, or the presence of a warmer air layer in the middle of two cold air layers, this form of insertion prevents the dust from rising through this warm air layer, or we can call it as a ‘cover’. (This is different from normal conditions, in which the air should get colder as the height from the earth’s surface increases.) It also decreases the height of the atmosphere near the earth’s surface, known as the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL).

![Infographic: Weather conditions which affect PM2.5 Concentration](/images/portfolio/pm2-5/PM-7.png) 

Prof. Dr Siwatt Pongpiachan, the director of Disaster Prevention and Management Research and Development Center at The National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) and a spokesperson for the government’s Center for Air Pollution Problems, explains to us about Temperature Inversion. He adds that the warmer, interspersed layer may be the warm air masses blowing in from any direction or the warm air masses produced by the exothermic heat at night from a building or structure. In addition, the inclination of the winter sun makes the air in the lowest layer above the earth surface cooler. Thus, the air is formed like a ‘layered pastry’ with a layer of warm air in the middle.

These two factors mentioned above, when combined, will affect the ventilation performance of PM2.5. This ventilation performance can be defined as a value called ‘Ventilation Index’, which is a multiplication between flat land wind speeds and PBL height. If one of these two multipliers is high, then the ventilation performance would be good. But if both factors are high, the ventilation performance would be excellent.

“If you remember, there was a time when the PBL height was very low. But fortunately, the wind that blew horizontally was powerful. Therefore, when the wind was still blowing, the horizontal ventilation was still good. Even though the vertical ventilation was bad, the horizontal ventilation was good, so the amount of PM2.5 was not much.” Prof. Dr Siwat concludes.

When asked about the ability of rain to solve the PM2.5 problem, he insists that “The rain must be heavy and must fall widely, then it can help. If the rain falls in just only small area, it may not help you much.”


## **Then about controllable sources, how much do we know about them?**

We already talked about ‘uncontrollable factors’, including topography and meteorological conditions. Now we will discuss several ‘controllable factors’ that ‘humans’ can control.

This may not be the first time you will hear assumptions such as “PM2.5 sources are road transportation, open-air burning, or industrial plants”. But if we ask about the proportion of PM2.5 from each source, many studies have various answers. Furthermore, various situations at different periods may cause the ratio of PM2.5 from each source to vary.

![PM2.5 problem in Bangkok](/images/portfolio/pm2-5/PM-9.jpg)

Siwaporn Rungsiyanon, another spokesperson for the government’s Center for Air Pollution Problems, explains two methods of studies about PM2.5 sources. The first method is called the ‘Emission Inventory’, an approach to answer the question “Which sources in ’a certain city’ produce PM2.5, and how much PM2.5 that each source produce?”. In this method, we have to know about PM2.5 emissions from each type of source first; For example, the amount of PM2.5 that a car (in a particular model) or a factory emits. Then multiply by the number of sources in that type before compiling them into an inventory. This inventory must be updated with the latest information every five years.

Another method that Siwaporn explains to us is ‘Source Apportionment’. In this method, we collect PM2.5 samples in the atmosphere of the city where we study (as a ‘recipient city’) to analyze the composition of the sample PM2.5. The results are then compared with the composition of the particulate matter emitted from various sources. This will let us know the sources of PM2.5 circulating in that city and the proportion of PM2.5 from each source. She notes that PM2.5 in a recipient city may be produced from other cities.

When we searched some data back into the past, we found that these such studies were conducted many times. But in this article, we will pick only some recent studies. The first one is the study of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) published in 2017, a ‘Source Apportionment’ study collected PM2.5 samples from rooftops of two buildings in Bangkok and Pathum Thani province in the rainy and dry season. The result indicated that diesel engine exhaust was the top source of PM2.5 in the rainy season, but in the dry season, ‘Biomass burning’ clearly overtook as the top source of PM2.5. Moreover, the study also found that some parts of PM2.5 that flew into Bangkok and surrounding areas were ‘Secondary particulate matter’, which occurs spontaneously from condensing pollutant gases into very fine particulates. Two other parts of PM2.5 were from soil and industrial plants.

![Infographic3](/images/portfolio/pm2-5/PM-3.png) 
 
![Infographic4](/images/portfolio/pm2-5/PM-4.png) 

A year later (2018), there was another research released from the AIT. This time the researchers calculated and compiled an emission inventory. The result showed that the source which emitted PM2.5 the most in Bangkok and surrounding areas was road transportation, which accounted for 72.5 per cent of all emissions, followed by industrial plants, open-air burning, and other sources.

Another research, also released in 2018, was conducted by Assoc. Prof. Dr Savitri Garivait and others. They used the same technique as previously mentioned research. And the result was quite similar to that research: The source which emitted PM2.5 the most in Bangkok and surrounding areas was road transportation, which accounted for 50.79 per cent of all emissions. Nevertheless, as we have informed that emission inventory preparation includes only sources in only specific areas, in this case, was Bangkok and surrounding areas, so the inventory did not include PM2.5 emissions from open-air biomass burning in other provinces in the Central region of Thailand outside Bangkok and surrounding areas. The fine particulate matter from those other provinces might be able to flow into Bangkok as well.

![Infographic6](/images/portfolio/pm2-5/PM-6.png) 

And in December 2020, we talked to Assoc. Prof. Dr Saksit Chalermpong, deputy director of Transportation Institute at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand. He is a lead researcher in a team that just published a new article in Atmospheric Environment, a peer-reviewed scientific journal in environmental science. This article uses factors of land use characteristics, seasons, open-air burning, and traffic-related factors in 2019 to create a model called ‘Land-Use Regression Model (LUR)’ to observe the relationship between these factors and the concentration of PM2.5 in Bangkok. The conclusion from this study was different from the latest two studies mentioned earlier, indicating that even the traffic condition was an essential factor to the PM2.5 concentration, its impact was still lower than the factors of weather and open-air biomass burning. Assoc. Prof. Dr Saksit adds that the study reveals that open-air burning in the area with a 500 km radius around Bangkok impacted PM2.5 concentrations in Bangkok when the weather conditions met the criteria.

To find more opinions, we also talked to a leader in an NGO who raises questions and has different views on the sources of PM2.5.

Penchom Saetang, Director of Ecological Alert and Recovery Thailand (EARTH), said that from her experiences of working on the issue of pollution from the industrial sector, especially in the area in Samut Sakhon Province (besides Bangkok), her team found and was aware of the problem of heavy metals such as lead which were highly contaminated in the environment. She also reveals to us some facts from this area, such as high concentrations of dioxin were also found through analysis of the dust trapped in the eggs of chickens which naturally finds food for itself, and some recycling factories in the areas may not have appropriate air pollution treatment systems. This information made her feel confident that the industrial sector is more likely to be responsible for PM2.5 in Bangkok and its surrounding provinces than seen through the current studies.

Penchom also mentions another issue: Thailand still lacks Pollutant Release and Transfer Register law (PRTR Law), which made data about pollution emission from the industrial sector unclear.


## **‘There were many more things we want to know.’**

Based on the results of the studies and various opinions, we followed up with Atthaphon Charoenchansa, Director-General of Thailand’s Pollution Control Department. He reveals to us that there are some further studies about sources of PM2.5 which are currently being studied. Nevertheless, he says that we could distinguish specific sources of PM2.5 at any particular time nowadays using models by gathering various information about the weather and the floating of smog to see the distribution of PM2.5. This makes us know that the fine particulate matters in each area are likely to be caused mainly by which source. For instance, PM2.5 that forms itself in Bangkok should come from transportation, but if it forms itself in Bangkok’s surrounding provinces and is also related to hotspots, it should come from open-air burning.

He also shows us an image generated using a model to identify PM2.5 distribution between 13-14 December 2020. The image indicates that the primary source of fine particulate matters at that time was road traffic because PM2.5 formed itself in Bangkok and nearby areas. However, there were open-air burnings in other areas as well.

*(The image generated using a model to identify PM2.5 distribution between 13-14 December 2020)*

Still, the Director-General of the Pollution Control Department admits that we still lack a lot of knowledge about sources of PM2.5. He says the government has been trying to find a network to help, such as through the National Research Agency or other educational institutions. He assures us that it is possible to provide the budget to study this issue.

“There are still many things that we would like to know. For example, how much PM2.5 is emitted from the traffic sector, the diesel engine, the gasoline engine, and how they are different… and traffic jam index value. When we talk about traffic jams, we could explain traffic jams as an index value. Sample questions are, which index level will affect PM2.5 concentration, or how does it relate to PM2.5? Then, we should drill down into small area levels such as road level. So, if we could display PM2.5 values like the Google Map or display a detailed forecast in each area, this would help people a lot. We would love to have academia come and help us,” he said.

Furthermore, Prof. Dr Siwatt, a spokesperson for the government’s Center for Air Pollution Problems, also adds that if we define PM2.5 as ‘any particles’ smaller than 2.5 microns, then droplets smaller than 2.5 microns could be considered PM2.5 by this definition. Or even forests also play a role in PM2.5 emissions by this definition (in addition to trapping PM2.5). Nonetheless, the chemical composition of PM2.5 emitted from forests is much less toxic than PM2.5 from other sources we know. Therefore, he would like us to pay more attention to ‘composition in the particulate matters’ that may be harmful to the body, such as carcinogens or heavy metals.

These are only some pieces of research, data and opinions about the study of PM2.5 sources. We could see that even the major origins may not be far from what we know today: diesel car exhaust, open-air burning, industrial plants, etc. But there are still new methods and answers in this issue that are waiting for us to reach.

In the following article in this series, we will continue to delve into PM2.5 problem solving, especially from the primary sources.
