<p>The political crisis in Myanmar following the elections last year led to the seizure of power by the military. The prominent leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party were detained, followed by the announcement of a year-long state of emergency in the country, and the vice president was appointed as the interim president on February 1. The coup halted Myanmar’s progress on the path of democratic reform after the executive, legislative and judicial powers were transferred back into the hands of the military once again.</p>
<p>Although previously, the image of having a civilian government had become more apparent, there still are some areas in the mechanism of the Myanmar constitution which supports military involvement. We will explore here some of the provisions of the political system, elections, and the declaration of a state of emergency in the 2008 Myanmar constitution to get a clearer understanding of the relationship between the military and Myanmar politics until the day of the coup.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Legislative power and participation of the military</strong></h2>
<p>According to the Myanmar constitution, Myanmar’s sovereignty is divided into legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and these three powers have mechanisms for checks and balances among themselves. The constitution also states the division of powers in the Union, regions, states, and self-administered areas.</p>
<p>Inside the legislative power, there is a Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (or the national parliament). It consists of The Pyithu Hluttaw (lower house) with a maximum of 440 representatives and the Amyotha Hluttaw (upper house) with a maximum of 224 representatives. 75% of the members in both houses were elected, and the commander in chief appointed another 25% of members in both houses.</p>
<p>In addition, Region Hluttaws and State Hluttaws (Hluttaw means legislative assembly) act as the legislature in each region or state. Both Hluttaws also have both elected members and military personnel appointed by the commander in chief. The members from the military side also accounted for 25% of the total members of that Hluttaw. This legislative assembly structure is one of the issues noted that deserves to be improved.</p>
<h2><strong>2. There must be military support in the constitutional amendment.</strong></h2>
<p>However, the constitutional amendment is not so easy. Section 436(a) in the constitution requires amendments to many Sections in the constitution, having to be approved by more than 75% of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw members and passing a nationwide referendum with more than half of all voters voting in favour.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Section 436(b) states that to amend other Sections not stipulated in Section 436(a), although a referendum is not required, it must still be approved by more than 75% of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw members. We should not forget that 25% of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw members are appointed from the military side. Therefore, so without military support, it isn’t easy to amend the constitution successfully.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Presidential election must have a candidate from the military.</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to the legislative powers, the executive powers are also involved with the military. The president of Myanmar must be elected from persons nominated by three parties: the elected members of the lower house, the elected members of the upper house, and the members of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (the national parliament) appointed by the commander in chief. Each party nominates one person, then the members of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, both the lower and upper house, will vote for the new president. The person with the highest number of votes will be the president, and the remaining two will be vice presidents. This approach means that among these three positions, there must be one person from the military.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Selected persons from the military must sit as ministers in at least three ministries.</strong></h2>
<p>Furthermore, those who will be ministers and deputy ministers in three ministries: the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Ministry of Border Affairs, must be military personnel nominated by the commander in chief. Suppose the president desires to appoint military personnel as the ministers or deputy ministers in other ministries apart from the three ministries mentioned. In that case, the president must coordinate with the commander in chief.</p>
<h2><strong>5. The military has a majority in the National Defense and Security Council.</strong></h2>
<p>In the executive branch, there is another essential body: the National Defense and Security Council. The council has 11 members: one president, two vice-presidents, ministers from 4 ministries, the speaker of the lower house, the president of the upper house, commander in chief, and deputy commander in chief. According to the structure, at least 6 out of 11 members belong to the military, which means the military occupies a majority in this council.</p>
<p>The National Defense and Security Council has several essential functions, including approving the person to be the commander in chief or coordination in the declaration of a state of emergency under various sections in the constitution, including Section 417, which was cited in the declaration of a state of emergency on February 1. We will discuss this further in the next topic.</p>
<h2><strong>6. The military and the constitutional seizure of power</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Myanmar constitution states that the National Defense and Security Council plays a role in coordinating the declaration of a state of emergency under several Sections. The most recent declaration was the coup on February 1, when Acting President Myint Swe declared a state of emergency using Section 417 of the constitution. The Section specifies the indicator for declaring a state of emergency if there is sufficient reason “that may disintegrate the Union or disintegrate national solidarity or that may cause the loss of sovereignty, due to acts or attempts to take over the sovereignty of the Union by insurgency, violence and wrongful forcible means”. The duration of the state of emergency under this Section is one year.</p>
<p>And when a state of emergency is declared under this Section, the president will declare the transferring of legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the Union to the commander in chief, to allow the commander in chief to take the necessary measures to quickly bring the situations back to normal. The constitution also stipulates that a state of emergency declaration can be extended twice, six months per extension, under the coordination between the president and the National Defense and Security Council.</p>
<p>These are military-related mechanisms written in the current constitution of Myanmar. Although Myanmar’s political system is opening more space for the political activities of the stakeholders, the military still involves itself in many parts of the political process. Eventually, the mechanisms were already used on the day of the coup as well.</p>
